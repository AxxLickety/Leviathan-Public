# Leviathan – Regime-Aware Housing Signal Research

## Objective
This project studies how affordability regimes alter forward housing return distributions and tests exposure conditioning to reduce downside tail risk.

## Research Structure
1. Regime classification (affordability state modeling)
2. Signal construction (affordability & supply interaction)
3. Forward return evaluation
4. Out-of-sample validation
5. Exposure surface experimentation

## Key Insight
Regime-conditioned exposure reduces left-tail vulnerability in fragile affordability states.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Panel construction
- Signal engineering
- Regime classification
- OOS validation
- Risk discipline

## Status
Research project. Prototype-level validation completed on Austin panel.
