# Leviathan — Regime-Conditioned Housing Signal (Public Snapshot)

Leviathan is a research prototype exploring whether affordability regimes structurally alter forward housing return distributions.

Core hypothesis:
Conditioning exposure during fragile affordability states compresses left-tail risk without fully sacrificing upside.

This public repository includes:
- A minimal runnable demo
- A transparent pipeline (data → signal → forward return → regime → evaluation)
- Example data for reproducibility
- No proprietary datasets

Demonstrated capabilities:
- Panel construction & feature engineering
- Regime classification logic
- Signal interaction modeling (affordability × supply)
- Forward return evaluation
- OOS and tail-risk awareness

## Why this matters

Housing markets exhibit structural regime shifts.
Ignoring regime effects can distort forward risk distribution.

This project focuses on:
- Distribution-aware modeling
- Downside tail compression
- Exposure conditioning logic

Designed as a research-first applied quant prototype.

Status:
Prototype-level validation completed (Austin panel).
Public version designed for transparency and collaboration.
